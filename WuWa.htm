        <h2>Wuthering Waves</h2>
        <p>Wuthering Waves was revealed on May 23, 2022, on Kuro Games' social media accounts. It was announced for iOS
            on March 25, 2024. Development happened at Kuro Games's recently opened facility in Hong Kong, instead of
            its main studio in Guangzhou.
            The game underwent two closed beta tests, with the second concluding in March 2024.</p>
        <p>Wuthering Waves is set in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world after a catastrophe called the Lament wiped
            out most of humanity and caused unknown beings and monsters, called Tacet Discords, to appear. Humanity
            adapted to the threat and over time rebuilt civilization. The story follows the amnesiac Rover, who has
            awakened from a deep slumber and sets out to explore this new world.</p>
        <p>Wuthering Waves is set in an open world. The player controls the protagonist Rover, as well as recruited
            allies called Resonators, which are split into 4-star and 5-star rarities. The endgame content features
            modes where characters can be used in a series of combat challenges.
            The game's combat system features Intro and Outro skills; Intro skills are triggered when the characters
            enter combat, and Outro skills are triggered when the characters leave combat. Both abilities (skills) are
            triggered when the characters are switched.</p>
